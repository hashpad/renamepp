---

## Overview

* **Recursively scans** a directory tree for files with the extension(s) you supply.
* **Opens** each match using `xdg-open`.
* When the viewer closes, a minimalist **ncurses** interface lets you:

  * Rename the current file.
  * Move to the next/previous file (j,k).
  * Reâ€‘open the current file.
* It sets the cursor on rename, and after renaming sets it to next, to you can fly through your files.
